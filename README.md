# ANTH-641_Week-4-
Week 4

This week we're working on cleaning files using Open Refine. 
The first database I'm cleaning is Petra Excavation Trenches.csv. The following changes were made:
1. Fixed the cluster of Special Project (there were additional spaces added)
2. Cleaned up additional spaces in Locus columns which included extra spaces or a - sign/typo
3. Question marked data was kept separate and not clustered unless there were different versions of adding a question to the data e.g. 11?, 11(possibly) or 11(?). 11(?) was the retained method. Even if there was only a singular line for a certain number, I edited other versions to reflect a singular method. 
4. Cleaned up Capitalization errors
